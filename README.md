These Gcode start and end files are made to use with the Chitu Plate Cycler on the Bambu Lab A1 Mini. 
- The Start GCODE has a lot of the startup steps moved to a different XY location to prevent the printer from unhooking the bed on startup.
- The END GCODE does the full plate swap cycle like it does using the Chity cycle software.
